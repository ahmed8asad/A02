Step 1- Getting Git and Webstorm:

Git allows a user to track all of their history when coding. It also enables its users to publish files on the internet that could be collaborated on through GitHub.
Download Git using this url: https://git-scm.com/downloads

WebStorm is a platform in which one can code and develop JavaString programs. Download it here : https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students

Connect your GitHub to WebStorm through System Settings by creating a path to git.exe.

Step 2- Creating a Project:

Create a New project within WebStorm.

Create a new HTML file.(right click empty space underneath files.) 

Make some changes in the file, and then select VCS in the dropdown menu to the right of A02 at the top of the page.
Create a Git Repository.

Select 'master' in the top toolbar of the window, and select commit.

Select your html file, create a commit and then commit. 

Step 3- Getting the file on GitHub:

Using the Search option in the aforementioned top toolbar, search 'Share Project on GitHub'.
After inserting your username and email, you should be able to access this repository on GitHub.

WebStorm in Relation to GitHub and GIT:

In large part, WebStorm will be the platform in which most of your coding will be done. GitHub is the place in which that code can be shared,
and GIT serves as a logbook for changes made to your code.
